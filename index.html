    <p>Here’s our starting principle:</p>
    <h4>
      A polished, professional landing page can improve your conversion rates.
      (And a messy one can hurt them.)
    </h4>
    <p>
      Pretty simple, right? You’ve probably heard something similar before. But
      what the heck does it mean to be “polished” and “professional” on a
      landing page, anyway? And when it comes to conversions, what’s the magical
      x-factor that sets exceptional marketers apart?
    </p>
    <p>
      With these questions in mind, we want to show off some fresh landing page
      examples to inspire your next creation. Go ahead and save their smartest,
      slickest, and snappiest elements for your swipe file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, we’ll offer an Unbounce-certified perspective on what makes
      each page so darn good—and, occasionally, how each could be improved.
      (Incidentally, most of these were actually built with the
      <a
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
        href="/features/"
        target="_blank"
        >Unbounce Builder</a
      >, too.) Let’s go.
    </p>
    <h2>What makes a landing page effective?</h2>
    <p>
      Before looking at the examples, it’s worth highlighting some of the
      qualities that most great landing pages share. (Ain’t got time for that?
      <a href="#examples">Jump ahead for the top landing page examples</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are a few fundamental practices of high-converting landing pages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use a clear and concise value statement (above the fold) so visitors
        understand the purpose of your page immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Match your primary headline to the ad your visitor clicked to land on
        the page in the first place (or the button of the email CTA, for
        example).
      </li>
      <li>Include social proof and testimonials to back up your claims.</li>
      <li>
        Focus the whole page on a single offer, with just one primary call to
        action (CTA).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a
        <a
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
          href="/landing-page-design/designing-for-conversion-8-visual-design-techniques-to-focus-attention-on-your-landing-pages/"
          target="_blank"
          >conversion-centered layout</a
        >
        to make your CTA stand out (think about whitespace, color, contrast, and
        directional cues).
      </li>
      <li>
        Test new ideas using
        <a href="/landing-page-articles/what-is-ab-testing/">A/B testing</a>.
        Sometimes what works will surprise you.

    <p>
      Remember the first time you heard about Netflix? The streaming service
      seemed almost too good to be true with unlimited movies and TV shows for
      less than $10 a month. What a killer value proposition… it’s no wonder
      they put the competition out of business. (RIP, Blockbuster.) This landing
      page reinforces those most important benefits without making it seem too
      complicated or difficult for anyone to sign up. And obviously this
      strategy has been working—recent reports show Netflix currently sitting at
      over

    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>One-Field Form </strong>– A big, intimidating form on this page
        could easily scare away folks who aren’t tech-savvy. But Netflix wants
        to appeal to everyone *and* their grandparents. That’s why they make the
        first step super simple—just enter your email to get started.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drop-Down FAQ</strong> – Over the years, Netflix has raised its
        pricing a number of times. That’s why they’ve moved down this part of
        their value proposition into a drop-down FAQ at the bottom of the page.
        They’re still telling you that info on the page so you don’t click away,
        but they’re no longer making a big deal out of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Short-Form Content </strong>– While many Netflix shows take a
        long time to binge through, you can digest this landing page in just a
        few seconds. There are fewer than 200 words of copy here, and every
        benefit only has a line or two of supporting text. This is smart since
        according to the

          href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report/#media_and_entertainment"
          >2020 Conversion Benchmark Report</a
        >
        media and entertainment landing pages below 350 words tend to convert
        better.

      Just about everyone has a LinkedIn profile these days, but only the people
      who are serious about advancing their careers have signed up for LinkedIn
      Premium. This landing page highlights the benefits of upgrading your
      account specifically for job seekers who are looking to stand out in the
      job market. (Because apparently my dad’s advice about giving a firm
      handshake and making lots of eye contact isn’t enough anymore? Who knew.)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> SaaS / Professional Services</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>People over product</strong> – It’s always a tricky balance in
        SaaS whether you should show a screenshot of your product first or a
        photo of a customer who’s actually using it. That’s why I really like
        the approach LinkedIn has taken here, mixing custom photography of
        smiling job applicants (who is that happy when they’re applying for a
        job?!) with 3D images showing off Premium features. Truly the best of
        both worlds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jump links</strong> – For longer landing pages like this one, it
        can be helpful to place anchor links at the top of the page. This way,
        visitors can skip ahead to the parts that interest them most.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Powerful statistics</strong> – There’s no real social proof on
        this page (a testimonial from a LinkedIn Premium user would be nice to
        see) but there is a powerful bit of data. “InMail is 2.6x more effective
        than emails alone.” That’s HUGE for job seekers looking to connect with
        hiring managers or recruiters, and I would guess it’s probably one of
        the main reasons why visitors sign up for Premium in the first place.
        I’d recommend running an
        <a href="https://unbounce.com/product/features/unlimited-ab-testing/"
          >A/B test</a
        >
        to see if bringing that stat into the page headline would increase
        conversions further.

      “Brushing perfected.” That’s what this landing page from Goby promises
      right at the top, giving visitors the confidence and curiosity to
      click-through. Not only does their award-winning electric toothbrush come
      with some impressive accolades, but it’s also affordable and backed up by
      a money-back guarantee. Now that’s worth a smile!
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Dentistry</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Anatomy of a Toothbrush: </strong>Check out the section of the
        page that breaks down every element of the toothbrush. Rather than just
        talk about these features in the copy, visitors can actually see for
        themselves the “Soft, Premium Bristles” and the “Oscillating Brush
        Head.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social impact message: </strong>Shoppers increasingly want to
        support brands that align with their values and give back to the
        community. That’s why we dig the section towards the bottom of the page
        that highlights how Goby is donating a percentage of every sale to the
        NYU College of Dentistry’s Global Student Outreach program.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Instagram photos:</strong> There are all sorts of great social
        proof on the page, but the carousel of Instagram photos at the bottom
        really puts the cherry on top. Not only does each pic somehow make a
        toothbrush look downright <em>trendy</em>, but the Instagram handles are
        also right there if you want to see for yourself what each influencer
        had to say. Nice!

      Food delivery is big business, and companies like DoorDash are using
      landing pages to get more drivers to sign up for their service. This page
      helps you visualize what it will be like to deliver food for a living and
      highlights just how much money you could be making with your new full-time
      gig or side-hustle.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry: </strong>SaaS / Food Delivery</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>You-Focused Headline</strong> – What’s the biggest advantage of
        being a food delivery person? It’s not the fact that you’ll learn every
        traffic shortcut in your city, nor is it the delicious smell of food
        that permeates into your vehicle (10 years later and my car still smells
        like pepperoni pizza). The biggest advantage is the freedom you get. You
        can work your own hours and be your own boss. And this landing page
        nails that feeling right in the headline.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It’s All About the Money, Too </strong>– If freedom is the main
        benefit of becoming a DoorDash driver, the other benefit has gotta be
        the money. Check out that hero graphic that shows your potential weekly
        earnings. (Not bad for driving around town with some tacos in your
        trunk!)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Qualifying Requirements</strong> – DoorDash doesn’t want
        everybody applying for a position and overloading their HR department.
        That’s why they make a point of listing the requirements here on the
        first page of the sign-up process. So if you don’t have a car or still
        haven’t turned 18 yet, you know not to get your hopes up.

      If you’re a digital marketer, you’re probably already familiar with SEM
      Rush. Their platform offers an all-in-one toolkit for SEO, content
      marketing, PPC, social media, and market research. But rather than try to
      sell you on all of these things at the same time, this landing page
      narrows its focus on just one thing: how you can use their platform to
      learn more about your competitors.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> SaaS / Marketing</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Ultra-Compelling CTA </strong>– The CTA on this page taps into
        every marketer’s innate desire to spy on the competition. (Wait, is that
        just me?) The one-field form asks you to enter *any* domain name before
        prompting you to click the big button and “Get Insights.” And the
        supporting text in the hero section really helps to sell you on the
        idea: “See where their traffic comes from and how engaged their users
        are.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strong social proof</strong> – This landing page hits almost
        every type of social proof out there. Logo bar with recognizable brands?
        Check. Industry awards and credentials? Check. Testimonials from real
        marketers? Check. And if that wasn’t enough, there’s also a carousel of
        Tweets at the bottom showing off recent chatter about the platform
        online.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audience-aware copy</strong> – To create a high-converting
        landing page, you’ve got to know your audience and speak to the benefits
        they care about most. The copy here focuses on big data and machine
        learning algorithms because they’re after data-driven
        marketers.&nbsp;Smart.

      Even as a full-grown adult man, I still squealed with delight when I saw
      some of the beds and bedding sets on this landing page for Coco Village.
      (A treehouse bunkbed?! My inner child is dying of jealousy.) The marketers
      over at
      <a
        href="https://www.j7media.com/en/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label="J7 Media (opens in a new tab)"
        >J7 Media</a
      >, a Facebook Ads agency, did a phenomenal job on having this landing page
      show off a collection of different products, while still keeping it
      focused on a single, click-through goal.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Bedding</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Focus on the sale: </strong>When you’re offering a big sale or
        discount, you want *everyone* to know about it. And visitors on this
        landing page can’t miss the fact that they’re offering “50% Off Beds and
        Bedding Sets.” Not only is that the main headline, but it’s also
        repeated under each product on every CTA. They even strikethrough the
        original prices to illustrate how much money you’ll be saving. Nice!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shows off the goods: </strong>With ecommerce landing pages, it’s
        not always the best choice to focus on just one product or item. This
        page demonstrates how you can show off multiple different options for
        visitors while keeping them focused on one CTA goal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Additional products: </strong>OK, so maybe you’re like me and
        think the beds look cool but you don’t really need one of those right
        now. That’s when the page hits with you some of the adorable pillows for
        sale, at much lower price points. (I may or may not be purchasing the
        one that looks like a snail for myself.)

      There’s a growing demand for grass-fed meat, which is where this landing
      page from the Grass Roots Farmers’ Cooperative and the agency
      <a
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label="Mutesix (opens in a new tab)"
        href="https://www.mutesix.com/"
        target="_blank"
        >MuteSix</a
      >
      comes into the mix. As you scroll through the page, you’re taken on the
      full customer journey—from problem aware (understanding why grass-fed meat
      is better), through consideration (seeing why you should choose Grass
      Roots as your protein provider), to making a purchase (“Claim Your $30
      Off”).

    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Feature video: </strong>At the top of the page is a 1-minute
        video featuring the founder and CEO of Bulletproof, Dave Asprey. It
        explains how challenging it can be to source high-quality grass-fed
        meat, and why Dave uses Grass Roots for the meat he can’t find in the
        grocery store. This sets the tone nicely for the rest of the page and
        gets you in the right mindset for making a purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Storytelling approach: </strong>The entire page uses
        storytelling in a similar way, really getting you to buy into eating
        more grass-fed meat as a lifestyle choice. As you scroll, you can’t help
        but feel like you’ve been missing out on this healthier (and more tasty)
        style of beef, chicken, and bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strong social proof: </strong>Not only does this page show off
        that Grass Roots is the only Bulletproof-approved meat delivery company,
        it also promotes that they have over 500 5-star reviews and 7,000 happy
        customers. (“I’ll have what they’re having.”)

      Here’s a landing page that <em>on paper</em> doesn’t seem to work at all.
      The colors here are incredibly disjointed. There are multiple different
      art styles. The content seems to be all over the place. Heck, the page
      even has multiple links out to other pages and exit points. (The horror!)
      But Amazon somehow manages to get away with breaking all of these rules
      because they know their offer is too good to pass up.

        for Amazon Prime and they’ll answer you in the same order these sections
        appear on the landing page. Free shipping is the main benefit, followed
        by Prime Video. The rest are bonuses, so they’re shown as add-ons as you
        get farther down the page. (And with the

        <strong>Click-Through CTA</strong> – Whether you consider this a SaaS

      As someone who had to recently furnish a home office, I know exactly how
      difficult it can be to find desks, chairs, and tables you like online.
      (And that was just for one person!)
      <a href="https://www.branchfurniture.com/">Branch Furniture</a>
      understands that this can be a problem for office managers, which is why
      their landing page instantly reassures you that you’re in the right place.
      Their service makes it fast and easy to get your office furniture
      designed, shipped, and installed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Office Furniture</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Powerful headline: </strong>“Office Furniture Made Easy.” In
        just four words, you understand who this landing page is trying to
        target and what their unique selling proposition (USP) is. You don’t
        want to be building 100 desks for your new office Ikea-style, with
        nothing but a socket wrench and a dream. It seems like a much better
        idea to let Branch Furniture handle all those details for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clever CTA copy: </strong>Although the page has multiple CTA
        buttons, they all end up taking you to the same place. Switching up the
        copy is a clever way to help visitors visualize the next steps of the
        process, whether you want to “Design My Office” or explore a specific
        product.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Expert consultation:</strong> You don’t have to furnish your
        office alone. The landing page highlights that this is a collaborative
        shopping experience, with a free design consultation and included
        installation fees.

      Sometimes when prepping a piece like this one, you end up buying the
      product. I’m very, very close to pulling the trigger on a pair of Western
      Rise’s AT Slim Rivet Pants. And why not? This sharp landing page quickly
      establishes the appeal of the product through visuals and copy that
      stresses the benefits of these “elevated” pants. It may be time to give up
      on my ratty jeans altogether.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Clothier</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bold visuals:</strong> These pants may be handmade in Los
        Angeles, but many of the photos here (including the hero shot) scream
        Brooklyn. It’s easy to imagine wearing the AT Slim Rivet Pants as you
        peddle your fixie through traffic, balancing a latte on your handlebars
        on the way to a chic rooftop cocktail party.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stressing the benefits:</strong> I never thought I’d be writing
        about the common pain points associated with wearing pants, but here we
        are. On this landing page, Western Rise addresses them all. Jeans are
        prone to tearing and tend to overheat. Chinos get dirty and wrinkled.
        Dress pants are for squares, man. By promising versatility (“pants for
        all day, every day”) and keeping the benefits up front, Western Rise
        offers a solution to a problem you didn’t know you had.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Tech specs”:</strong> Though there’s some clever copy on
        display here, Western Rise is extremely straightforward about the
        features of the AT Slim Rivet Pants in the “Tech specs” section on the
        page. They provide precise details about materials (“Durable Nylon
        Canvas” and “Gusseted Crotch”) and design (“Media Pocket” and
        “Extendable Hem”) in a clear, concise way.

      Athabasca University pioneered distance education in Canada in the 1970s.
      Today, it uses landing pages to boost its online enrolment initiatives,
      including this example representing its 14 certificate programs. It’s a
      smart choice since landing pages allow AU to focus a visitor’s attention
      on a particular slice of its many online program offerings.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Education</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Smart copy:</strong> It might be worth testing out a more direct
        headline, but the copy here matches the school’s other branding
        initiatives elsewhere. It’s also very sharp. The target is clear: people
        who might further their education but don’t feel they have time to
        pursue it. This landing page says otherwise (in words and in its hero
        image).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You-oriented copy:</strong> This page is all about me (or, uh,
        “you”) and not about the “Great and Powerful” Athabasca University.
        Marketers working in education understand the need to appeal to
        self-interest better than many of their counterparts in other
        industries, who can slip into bragging. I’m not sure what part of
        Maslow’s hierarchy of needs calls for tech bro flexing, but AU does
        better by appealing to a desire for self-actualization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testimonials:</strong> A little bit of inspiration never hurts.
        Here, the social proof shows pathways to personal success before people
        make a significant investment. I’d test to see if doubling down doesn’t
        produce even better results here. Giving each testimonial more
        visibility and offering a smidge more biography—along with portraits to
        humanize them—might provide a little boost. (Of course, it might not.
        But that’s why we

          >test</a
        >!)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Z-pattern:</strong> This page is a classic example of a
        Z-pattern at work. That is—its visual hierarchy takes advantage of the
        way people typically scan a webpage. In this case, the eye is encouraged
        to travel from the Athabasca University logo to their tagline (“Open.
        Flexible. Everywhere.”), then diagonally across the heading to the
        supporting copy, and then finally right to the call to action. (Pow!)
        Other visual queues also encourage the eye to move down (including,
        cleverly, the pointed tip of Athabasca crest).

      Here’s a page for Bariatric Eating that shows why personality and style
      are so important to your landing page. You can easily imagine a version of
      this campaign that looks much more clinical and scientific—but the
      marketers over at Lifestyle Collective have infused it with a colorful and
      friendly design to make the subject matter much more approachable. The
      approach seems to be working too…
      <strong>This page has an impressive conversion rate of over 39%</strong>.

    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Food and Nutrition</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Colorful design</strong>: The playful design extends to every
        element of the page. The font choices, the illustrations, the
        colors—everything comes together in a way that perfectly matches their
        brand personality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SMS lead gen: </strong>Most commonly, lead generation landing
        pages are used to collect email addresses from visitors. Instead, this
        page asks for your mobile phone number so they can text you the PDF
        plan. This seems like a smart (and unique) way to get a direct line of
        communication with your prospects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collapsible FAQ</strong>: How do you make sure your landing page
        has enough info on it without overwhelming visitors? Hiding some of your
        wordiest sections with a slide-down button can help to keep things neat
        and tidy. (Check out

    <p>
      If you look past the buzzy “Uber for beauty” thing, UK brand blow LTD.
      solves a genuine problem in a <em>genius</em> way. They offer affordable,
      professional beauty services that come to you, and—more importantly—you
      can book an appointment with one of their pros straight from their app.
      Smartly, landing pages are a big part of their campaign strategy. The
      example, for instance, promotes in-home eyelash extensions in clever ways.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Beauty</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Crystal-clear value statement:</strong> This landing page
        doesn’t mess around with cute copy (e.g., “Eyes That Amaze”). Instead,
        it clearly states the offer and relies on value (and maybe a little bit
        of novelty) to win over prospective customers. A promise doesn’t get
        more unambiguous than “Eyelash Extensions At Home,” and that’s precisely
        why this headline is so effective.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Promo code:</strong> Providing a promo code to visitors sweetens
        the pot, but it’s also doing something more. The call to action (“Book
        Eyelash Extensions”) redirects to their main website, where they might
        get distracted or frustrated. The promo provides extra motivation to
        carry visitors through to complete a booking. Want these savings? Then
        ya’d best use that code before you forget.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social proof:</strong> People are understandably picky about who
        does their hair and makeup, so providing social proof is a must. The
        testimonials here have been selected to highlight the personalized
        nature of the experience too. Since blow LTD. only works if prospects
        feel they can trust their professionals, providing social proof helps
        humanize the service and start building relationships.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simple steps:</strong> Looking further down the page, we might
        pause over the “How It Works” section. In this post-Uber world, the
        service offered by blow LTD. is pretty easy to understand, so why bother
        including a three-step breakdown of it? That’s just the point, though.
        This landing page includes these steps to highlight this simplicity. I
        mean, come on—step three is “Sit Back &amp; Relax.” That’s something I
        can get behind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subtle app promotion:</strong> Rather than aggressively
        funneling visitors into an app, the landing page ends with a gentle
        reminder that you can download the app on your iPhone or Android. (I’d
        test a mobile variant of the CTA that goes straight to the app.) Some
        people will certainly get excited about booking with blow LTD. on the
        go, but visitors don’t feel too pressured to whip out their smartphone.
        Once a visitor has converted, there’ll be plenty of other opportunities
        to onboard them to the app.
      </li>
    </ul>

      cannabis culture. (Tie-dye colors, bong water, and that funky smell coming
      from your older brother’s van.) But this stellar B2B landing page takes
      modernized and, dare we say, adult approach to wholesale hemp oil
      extracts. From its clean design to persuasive copy, it makes a strong case
      that this is an industry that demands to be taken seriously.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Hemp</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Expert copy:</strong> Unlike B2C landing pages, this page speaks
        to a professional crowd. By which I mean, people who know what it means
        when plant extract contains “natural terpenes” and has been
        “decarboxylated.” We might suggest going with a more impactful headline,
        but wholesalers are likely very aware of the benefits. Cutting to the
        chase can’t be a bad thing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A ‘refined’ approach:</strong> Blue Forest Farms market hemp oil
        in several states, from crude oil to white label products ready for the
        market. Beyond just listing these options, this landing page lays out
        the process through which their hemp is refined, emphasizing the care
        and craft that go into it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Low-intensity lead gen:</strong> I’ve seen shorter forms, but
        the lead gen here is relatively straightforward for B2B. (They could
        test including first and last name in the same field and change some of
        the language.) It’s smart to leave an optional field for additional
        notes since wholesale deals are far more complex than most.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simple design:</strong> The kind of conversation that needs to
        happen in wholesale will stretch beyond a single landing page. Instead
        of cramming too much information onto the page, Blue Forest Farms keep
        it short and sweet to encourage contact as soon as possible.

    <p>
      Ever try to cross the border with a 10-pound wheel of Wisconsin cheddar
      strapped into the passenger seat (and disguised as your wife)? Me neither.
      But if I did, I’d want Border Buddy behind me. This landing page works by
      evoking common anxieties and then offering to solve them without fuss.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Customs</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Presenting the problem:</strong> The headline starts with the
        pain and insecurity (“Importing and Exporting Is Hard”) that any visitor
        who hits this landing page from a PPC campaign is likely to be feeling.
        Crucially, though, the promise of a solution appears with equal clarity
        above the fold: “We do the hard part for you,” says Border Buddy.
        Perfect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simplicity:</strong> Bringing your purchases across the border
        can get very messy, so keeping this landing page clean is essential.
        There’s no more information here than what you need to know. No legalese
        either. You’ll have a customs broker worrying about all those small
        details for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed:</strong> At Unbounce, we have a lot to say about
        <a
          href="/page-speed-report"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
          >the impact that page speed can have on your conversion rates</a
        >. But Border Buddy is already ahead of the curve on this one. On
        mobile, this landing page takes less than three seconds to hit first
        meaningful paint. Border Buddy avoids weighing down the page with
        unnecessary media or scripts, ensuring immediate visitor engagement.
        (Prepping an SVG version of their logo could shave a few kilobytes off
        of what’s already a very lean page.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unexpected vibrancy:</strong> Sometimes marketers associate the
        push for faster speeds with a need to sacrifice the visual appeal of a
        landing page. This example from Border Buddy shows it that doesn’t have
        to be the case. They’ve made careful choices in terms of font, layout,
        and visuals to maximize impact and reinforce branding (without
        distracting the visitor).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>F-pattern:</strong> Like the Z-pattern, the F-pattern layout
        mimics the way our eyes move across the screen when we look at content.
        It reduces
        <a
          rel="noopener noreferrer"

        >
        and ensures that the key pieces of the message (including the call to
        action) are located in the places that they’ll most noticeable.

      created this gorgeous landing page for Bouquet Bar. Though other landing
      pages target specific holidays, this one says that you don’t need an
      excuse to treat someone you love (or, y’know, need to impress) to a
      bouquet. You can do it “Just Because.” Ryan Picardal, the designer who
      worked on it, describes their goals:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
      <p>
        For a fairly new brand, our team realized that we needed to capitalize
        on not only driving sales from these landing pages, but also expanding
        their audience. In order to achieve that, we needed to focus on putting
        enticing messaging and imagery at the forefront, and ensure that all key
        benefits Bouquet Bar provides are clearly visible and eye-catching.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Florist/Gifts</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose your own adventure:</strong> While maintaining focus is
        important, sometimes a single call to action doesn’t quite capture the
        types of visitors your landing page receives. In these cases, it can be
        quite effective to provide multiple options. For buyers who want to
        craft something personal, the first call to action invites you to create
        your own bouquet. But for those short on time or imagination, “curated
        selections” provide a shortcut to celebrating an important person or
        occasion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Just Because:</strong> 75% of roses sold in the US are purchased
        by men for Valentine’s Day. And 25% of all adults report buying flowers
        as gifts on Mother’s Day. It’s likely Bouquet Bar does a significant
        amount of business around these two days, but the “just because”
        messaging here invites business during the other 363 days of the year.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The right color palette:</strong> This point touches on Bouquet
        Bar’s overall branding, but it’s worth pointing out in the context of
        the “Just Because” page. Orange, particularly the deep shade they’ve
        chosen, aligns with the brand’s warm, sophisticated personality. A lot
        of what gets labeled as
        <a
          href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/psychology-of-color/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
          >the psychology of color is fairly dubious</a
        >—using pink won’t suddenly make your funeral home appear more
        cheerful—but the accents here definitely support the identity that
        Bouquet Bar wants to establish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Evocative photography:</strong> The gallery helps contextualize
        the product as an “expression of love, gratitude and friendship” by
        showcasing people receiving the gift. Images of people can be more
        effective at evoking emotions than words, so a company like Bouquet Bar
        is wise to employ them here. The photos also, much more practically,
        show scale. This can be a real concern when purchasing products sight
        unseen. It’s an excellent lesson for anyone practicing ecommerce.

    <p>
      Here’s a SaaS landing page that gets it right. Built by the fine marketers
      over at ConversionLab, this page for the email marketing platform Campaign
      Monitor brings together many of the
      <a
        href="https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/landing-page-best-practices/"
        >landing page best practices</a
      >
      that help to boost your conversion rates. It includes clear, compelling
      copy. (Check.) It includes authentic social proof. (Check.) And it’s
      focused on a single, actionable goal: “Design Your First HTML Email Now.”
      (Oh baby, check.)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: SaaS</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Strong, specific CTA:</strong> I know we already mentioned this
        above, but how good is that main CTA button?&nbsp; No “Learn More” or
        “Get Started” here. Instead, it’s “Design Your First HTML Email Now.”
        The copy is so specific and immediate that you know exactly what will
        happen when you click-through to the next page. (And the
        objection-handling copy underneath makes it even stronger.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Focus on the people first:</strong> In SaaS, it’s so easy to
        just choose a screenshot of the software and make that your hero image.
        But it’s always worth testing a variant with real photos of people, too.
        This can help you tap into the emotions of your visitors and can
        sometimes make them
        <a
          href="https://vwo.com/blog/human-landing-page-increase-conversion-rate/"
          >more likely to convert</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>One singular message</strong> – Notice how many times the words
        “HTML emails” show up on the page? By staying focused on this one goal
        (and using these as keywords for your PPC ad campaigns) you can increase
        your odds of building a high-converting page.

      Australia-based Class Creator uses this Unbounce landing page to make
      inroads in the US market (and, hopefully, help the company secure US
      partners) when school’s between sessions in their home country. The page
      showcases many of the product’s features as well as the primary benefits.
      It targets high-level decision-makers who need as much information as
      possible before they buy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Education/SaaS</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works..</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Breakin’ the rules:</strong> I know what you’re going to say.
        “That’s not a landing page. It’s a homepage. It breaks all the rules.
        Just look at that navigation bar! Look at all those different links. The
        <a
          href="/conversion-centered-design/attention.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
          >Attention Ratio</a
        >
        is out of control!” Grumble, grumble, grumble. But there’s a lesson here
        for anyone looking for landing page inspiration: <em>stay flexible</em>.
        Tim Bowman, Class Creator’s CEO, told me they’ve found it more success
        with this homepage than a traditional conversion-focused landing page. I
        wanted to include it here as an example of just what you can do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Floating navigation bar:</strong> If you must include a
        navigation bar, it’s best to keep it in view at all times. This also
        lets Class Creator keep the primary call to action (“Demo School”) at
        the top of the page so that no scrolling is necessary for their visitors
        to find it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The numbers don’t lie:</strong> Above the fold Class Creator
        marshals some pretty serious numbers as a form of social proof. They
        leverage the 10,000+ educators in 13 countries who’re already using
        their software as a powerful persuasive device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Easy access to a product demo:</strong> In the SaaS space, it’s
        remarkably common to see companies throw up too many barriers between
        potential customers and demoing their product. (“Submit your firstborn
        for access to our 5-minute free trial.”) Class Creator knows that it’s
        essential for prospects to get their hands dirty with a demo or trial
        version of the software. This ensures that they get to evaluate the
        product in action, generating qualified leads (with a simple email form)
        and carrying them further down the funnel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smart use of lightboxes:</strong> This landing page (acting as a
        homepage) already has a ton to say about Class Creator. Relegating any
        additional information to lightboxes works to keep it out of the way.
        It’d certainly be worth their while testing different versions of this
        page that swap out features for benefits or put the testimonials in a
        more prevalent place.

      that’s all too timely. Fast Mask creates and sells bandanas and face masks

    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Clothing and Apparel</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Highlight best-selling products</strong>: Fast Masks have over
        100 different designs listed on their website, but this landing page
        shows off just five of their most popular options. It’s enough to give
        you a sense of the different styles available (from a Canadian flag to a
        Spider-Man mask) without turning the page into one big product list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Focus on the benefits:</strong> A lot of visitors may be
        thinking about purchasing a face mask for the first time, so the landing
        page takes time to explain some of the key benefits of wearing one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keep your target audience in mind: </strong>This is a landing
        page that knows its audience. You can instantly tell you’re in the right
        place if you’re a thrill-seeker who enjoys motorcycles, paintball,
        snowboarding, hunting, or other extreme sports.

      for
      <a href="/landing-page-examples/best-landing-page-design-examples/"
        >this post about landing page design</a

      exception, but it also offers a masterclass in restraint. It shows how to
      use a promo to score conversions without becoming overbearing.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Grocery Delivery</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Freebies:</strong> Free seems universally good. But in this
        case, the promise of free is doing more than appealing to our
        instinctual love of <em>not paying for stuff</em>. It builds goodwill,
        provides a sample of a product that Good Egg carries, and quickly
        establishes a lifestyle match between the service and the visitor. What
        do I mean by lifestyle match? Well, if you’re thrilled by the getting
        free coconut water from Harmless Harvest, you already know Good Eggs
        will be a great fit for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added value:</strong> At first, I was taken aback by the
        headline here because I thought you’d hit harder with the whole free
        thing (like, I dunno, “Free Coconut Water” could work?). But it’s likely
        the average Good Eggs customer has more on their mind just getting a
        deal. Here, the promotion helps show off brand values of wellness,
        sustainability, and ethical labor practices. So it’s not just free, it’s
        also a <em>good</em> thing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testimonials:</strong> It can be a little risky to mention your
        competitors, but Good Eggs gets around this problem by letting a
        customer do it for them. Sometimes testimonials can get a little samey,
        repeating the same point in different voices. (That’s not always a bad
        thing.) Here, though, they’ve been carefully selected to reinforce the
        three value propositions listed above.

      when you have a poor credit score. (Is 670 a bad credit score? I’m asking
      for a friend.) This landing page does an excellent job of explaining how
      their service works in simple terms and encouraging visitors to apply
      online for their first loan.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Finance and Insurance</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Problem-focused: </strong>The headline here isn’t about the
        service—it’s about the visitor. “Poor credit score?” You know right away
        if this is the situation you’re dealing with, and the page immediately
        expresses empathy before suggesting HomeLoanGurus as a solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Process-oriented:</strong> Getting a home loan can be suuuuper
        complicated. There’s lots of paperwork, terminology, and regulations you
        have to wrap your head around. This landing page spells out the process
        in simple steps and helps to make it seem much easier for the visitor
        who might be worried about taking the first step.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keep it short: </strong>Financial landing pages vary in length,
        but data from the
        <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report/"
          >2020 Conversion Benchmark Report</a
        >
        suggests that those with fewer than 200 words tend to convert best. This
        example shows how you can say a lot without making your page too long.

    <p>
      For every person living in Vancouver, there must be at least six dogs. Jet
      Pet understands this city’s love of pooches, and they’re big fans of using
      the Unbounce Builder to advertise their premium dog boarding service and
      three locations to locals. We’ve included it here because this landing
      page is an inspiration for anyone targeting a select geographic area.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Pet Care/Boarding</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear value statement:</strong> A simple heading (“Dog Boarding
        Vancouver”) lets the searcher know they’ve hit the jackpot. For paid
        campaigns, Jet Pet can also use Unbounce’s
        <a
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
          href="/features/dynamic-text-replacement/"
          target="_blank"
          >Dynamic Keyword Replacement (DTR)</a
        >
        to swap in a search keyword (“Dog Kennels Vancouver”) for improved
        message match. Then, when a prospect clicks on an ad in Google, they’re
        brought to a page with a headline that matches their expectations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Two-stage form:</strong> Typically, using multi-step forms can
        lead to higher conversion rates than a single, long form. Here, a
        two-stage form reduces psychological friction in two ways. First, it
        minimizes the perceived effort in signing up for the service. (And even
        if the second form proves frustrating, someone who’s already filled out
        the first form is invested and more likely to continue onward. Sunk cost
        fallacy FTW.) Second, a
        <a
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
          href="/landing-pages/breadcrumb-technique-increase-landing-page-conversions/"
          target="_blank"
          >two-stage form can delay asking for more “sensitive” questions</a
        >
        until later.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Friendliness:</strong> Speaking of the form, I love that the
        first thing they ask you (and the only required field on the first page)
        is your dog’s <em>name</em>. I’d expect this question if I walked into
        one of their locations with my pup on a leash, but seeing the same
        question here made me smile. Jet Pet’s page is full of friendly gestures
        like this one that make them memorable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trust building:</strong> Trusting somebody else with your dog
        requires significant peace of mind. So it’s important that Jet Pet uses
        copy that builds that trust and leaves their customers feeling secure
        that they’ve left Fido with ”loving experts” who have his best interest
        in mind. The reassuring language that Jet Pet uses across the page
        reinforces this message, including emotionally loaded terms like “care,”
        “safe,” and “love.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Video testimonials:</strong> You don’t always need a video to
        have an effective testimonial, but in Jet Pet’s case, I think this is a
        smart move. There’s a lot of questionable testimony out there, so
        showing actual dog owners speaking to the camera helps build further
        credibility. (I’d love to see the dogs in these videos too.)

      who.) Created by

        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >BuzzShift</a
      >, the landing page reflects the brand’s playfulness and sense of fun
      embodied by their mascot. It’s also straightforward in a way that inspires
      a lot of confidence in their product. Cameron Gawley, BuzzShift’s
      co-founder and CEO, puts the choices here in a whole-funnel context:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
      <p>
        This specific page worked well in the consideration phase of our social
        ads. Our goal was to add value via a coupon, by capturing an email as a
        soft conversion and then nurture them forward in the rest of the
        journey. Most brands have a huge opportunity to grow lower their CPA and
        increase conversions by focusing more on awareness and consideration.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Beverages/Dairy Alternatives</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>From landing page to offline purchase:</strong> As Gawley points
        out, the promise of a coupon does double duty as a soft conversion. It
        builds an email nurture track and encourages an in-store purchase. Since
        tasting is believing, this is a crucial component of Mooala’s digital
        marketing strategy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meeting objections head-on:</strong> Banana haters gonna banana
        hate. But Mooala should be commended for immediately kicking one
        possible objection to the curb: “What is Bananamilk, you ask? It’s not a
        sugary-sweet banana smoothie, as you might think.” By boldly tackling
        this concern, the copy helps reset expectations and promote the product
        as “a light, dairy alternative that you can enjoy guilt-free.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A smartly placed animation:</strong> Videos and animations can
        be extraordinarily useful, but they can also serve as a distraction if
        not positioned correctly. I love the inclusion of animation at the
        bottom of the page, where it’ll draw the eye toward the CTA instead of
        distracting from Mooala’s primary messaging.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social queues:</strong> Encouraging visitors to follow the
        brand’s social media accounts increases the opportunities to be
        delightful and stay top of mind.

    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dark background</strong>: This landing page instantly stands out
        because of the black background. The coloring provides an upscale,
        premium atmosphere on the page that really helps to put the product in
        the best possible spotlight as a luxury experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Images you can practically smell:</strong> Some items are
        notoriously tricky to sell online. Candles, for example, seem like just
        the type of thing that most people would want to smell before they buy.
        (And until someone reinvents smell-o-vision for the modern era of
        advertising—that’s gonna be hard to pull off.) This page does a
        fantastic job of describing each candle aroma and showing off beautiful
        images of grapefruits, flowers, herbs, and spices to represent each
        fragrance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Add to cart” button:</strong> To make it easy for visitors to
        buy right on the landing page, Webistry used custom “Add to cart”

      Does anybody actually enjoy the process of getting car insurance? (Unless
      you’re a talking gecko, the answer is probably no.) You’ve got to contact
      multiple different insurers, compare their rates, and then painstakingly
      look through the contracts for hidden fees. But this landing page for
      Panda7 (another one built by
      <a
        href="https://webistry.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
        >Webistry</a
      >) promises to make things much easier for drivers—their service lets you
      compare quotes from all the major insurers and buy car insurance within
      minutes. Yes, please.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Finance and Insurance</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear benefits</strong>: The page makes it clear that there are
        two major benefits of using the service. First, it saves you time by
        letting you compare the best rates online. Second, it saves you money
        (up to 30%, in some cases). These two points are made over and over
        again in several different ways, so you can pick up on ‘em even if
        you’re skimming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>On-brand visuals</strong>: The page seamlessly integrates the
        royal purple brand color throughout the page, in everything from the
        illustrations to the background section colors. Very cohesive, and very
        professional looking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Floating CTA header</strong>: Check out that floating header.
        The button smartly responsively changes from a phone number at the top
        of the page to the main “Compare Quotes” CTA as you scroll. Very cool.

      We’re happy to show off this slick landing page from Pared, an app that
      matches (or, ahem, pairs) restaurants to pre-qualified kitchen staff. Like
      the example from Class Creator, Pared doesn’t need a complicated website
      to get their message out there. Unbounce’s drag-and-drop builder gives
      them the ability to make changes and track conversions. According to Dave
      Lu, Pared’s president and co-founder, it’s been effective, even three
      years later:

    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Restaurants/Staffing</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Speaks to its niche:</strong> Pared isn’t a service for everyone
        and they know it. Instead, they have a specific clientele whose needs
        they match in a big way. This landing page starts with one particular
        problem these people encounter: “Never be short-staffed again,” and goes
        from there. (They use other web assets for recruiting Pared Pros.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Explainer video:</strong> The landing page includes a short
        explainer that runs viewers through the problem and their solution to it
        in simple, approachable language. App landing pages, in particular,
        benefit from these types of videos.

      Here’s one more example from Webistry for Perfect Keto protein bars. The
      page does a great job not only selling these bars as the tasty treats that
      they are, but also highlighting their health and nutritional value. (Only
      three grams of net carbs in every bar? That means you could have six bars
      a day without coming out of ketosis!)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Food</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Healthy social proof</strong>: The page includes testimonials
        from a number of different keto diet influencers and authors.
        (Including… Joe Rogan? Sure, why not.) But there’s a lot more social
        proof too—they show off having over 2,500 reviews and having their brand
        appear in publications such as Women’s Health, Reader’s Digest, and
        Popsugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nailing the nutrition question: </strong>Keto dieters have to
        track their nutrition very closely, which is why this page is smart to
        include a close-up screenshot of the nutrition facts. Visitors can see
        for themselves the breakdown of calories in each bar, and examine each
        quality ingredient.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Includes use cases:</strong> About a third of the way down the
        page, I love the little section that tells you about what situations
        these keto bars are perfect for. From travel, to workouts, to
        grab-and-go breakfasts—you can imagine eating these as a snack or a meal
        in all sorts of different scenarios.

      created a page that buzzes with energy and excitement while staying
      focused on the conversion.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Adventure</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Capturing the experience:</strong> Twinwoods Adventure sell an
        experience, so social proof is critical in carrying visitors over the
        golden line from curiosity to conversion. (You can return a lousy
        product, after all, but bad experiences will be with you for life.) The
        page hits you with the double whammy of testimonials and review scores
        from Google, Facebook, and TripAdvisor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hype video:</strong> Some concepts demand video. Indoor
        skydiving is one of them. The mid-page video here does an incredible job
        of creating hype for the experience by showing off a range of skill
        levels. If you thought the wind tunnel was nothing but an oversized
        hairdryer, boy, you were wrong.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keep the number handy:</strong> Like many of the pages we’ve
        featured, the design encourages scrolling downwards (clicking the arrow
        below the CTA carries you to the benefits). But Twinwoods likely do a
        lot of booking over the phone, so a floating phone number keeps that
        particular call-to-action visible no matter where people end up on the
        page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Additional info:</strong> Before you get me into a jumpsuit,
        I’ve got more questions. (Like, where’d you guys get the wind tunnel
        anyway?) That’s why it’s a relief to find the info I need tucked away on
        the page. Arguably, these sections could be a little more evident as
        buttons, but Twinwoods Adventure smartly includes this additional info
        without stretching the page.

      I’ve had my share of bad roommate experiences, so I was immediately
      interested in this Roomeze landing page by
      <a

      >. Their service promises to matchmake you with vetted roommates around
      New York City and get you set up in an apartment for less than $1,000 a
      month. I wonder if there’s a way to check to make sure your future
      roommates don’t play the trombone? (Because trust me. You don’t want a
      roommate who plays the trombone.)

    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Style for miles:</strong> Moving can be stressful, but it can
        also be a lot of fun. The colorful illustrations on this page capture
        the latter feeling, making you excited about the prospect of a fresh
        start with new roommates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Compelling CTA: </strong>The main CTA on the page asks a
        question: “What can $1,000/mo get you?” If you’re at all familiar with
        New York City real estate, you know that a lot of places charge an arm
        and a leg for even a shoebox-sized apartment. The idea that you could
        find a potentially <em>nice</em> apartment for that price is very
        compelling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visual form:</strong> Check out the bottom of the page, where
        they ask you to fill out a simple form to take the first step. The UX
        here is pretty great, with the first two questions being simple
        checkboxes (including illustration visuals) to help get you started.

      Have you ever tasted cat food? (No, me neither. That would be weird.) I’d
      imagine that most of it doesn’t taste great though, and it’s probably not
      too good for you either. But that’s why this landing page for Smalls Food
      for Cats caught my attention. Their subscription-box service offers
      human-grade quality food for your feline friends. No fakery, no filler.
      There are wet and dry varieties that give your cat fresher breath in just
      one month—which means you can finally see what your cat’s breath smells
      like

    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Pet Food/Subscription Boxes</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Coupons: </strong>For subscription boxes, a coupon or discount
        can go a long way towards persuading visitors to give it a try. This
        page highlights that you can get 25% off your first box by using a
        <a href="https://unbounce.com/product/popups-and-sticky-bars/"
          >sticky bar</a
        >
        at the top of the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Colors: </strong>Orange! Yellow! Blue! The page breaks up each
        section with a different background color, giving the whole thing a fun
        and playful feel. (Check out those adorable illustrations in the
        benefits section, too.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cats</strong>: This landing page features over 11 fun
        photographs of cats enjoying the product, being held by their owners,
        and admiring themselves in the mirror (no doubt contemplating the
        delicious meal they just ate). The testimonials even show pictures of
        cats instead of people! <em>Too. Much. Cuteness.</em>

      When you own real estate that is dated or damaged, sometimes you just want
      to sell it as quickly as possible (for as much money as possible, of
      course). That’s where this landing page from Sundae makes it easy for
      you—their service helps you sell your home quickly for the best price
      possible.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Real Estate</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Minimalistic design: </strong>This landing page strips away
        almost all of the photography, animations, videos, and distractions that
        you find on other pages. It uses lots of white space to give you
        breathing room as you read, which is important in an industry that often
        clutters you with information and high-pressure sales tactics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Self-identifying copy: </strong>There are lots of reasons for
        someone to use a service like Sundae, and this page smartly calls them
        out right near the top. Whether you’ve inherited an older piece of
        property that you can’t keep, have uncovered structural issues, or
        suffered from natural disaster damage—Sundae specializes in helping you
        sell your home off-market in any condition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Persuasive comparison chart: </strong>It can sometimes be risky
        to directly compare your service to other options or competitors, but
        this page does it very well. They even highlight their two biggest
        benefits by putting them in all caps: “ZERO FEES” and “SELL AS-IS.”

        >Everett Andrew Marketing</a
      >, this brilliant landing page connects safety and fun together through
      carefully selected visuals and clear, concise messaging. According to Mark
      Chapman, Founder and President of Everett Andrew, this design was all
      about standing out:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
      <p>
        Our goal in creating the page was to cut through the clutter and crowded
        market of businesses here in southern California offering surf
        lessons—both on Google and Facebook. Getting each important conversion
        component (i.e. social proof, urgency, hero shot, CTA, etc.) into the
        page, mostly above the fold, was tricky but in the end we found a way to
        segment these out so each part catches the eye.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Surf Lessons</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Yelp score:</strong> Even the crummiest of products or services
        can gather together a few positive testimonials. (“The CEO’s mom thinks
        we’re cool.”) That’s why high scores from Yelp, TripAdvisor, Amazon, or
        Google can complement testimonials, as they do here. It’s much more
        challenging to maintain strong scores on these sites. (Just remember
        that visitors can always verify your score for themselves.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Timed special offer:</strong> Like many of the examples here,
        Wavehuggers add urgency to the landing page with a limited-time
        promotion. It may not seem like much—this kind of thing is almost a
        marketing cliche at this point—but even small tweaks like adding “for a
        limited time only” to a promo code can affect your conversion rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Safety, comfort, fun:</strong> Prospects are likely seeking out
        lessons to feel more comfortable on the water. Everything on this
        landing page focuses on the promise of a positive experience. The copy
        on this landing page reassures them throughout that surfing is “not as
        scary as you might think.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Real customers:</strong> The photographs here don’t have the
        polish of some of the others on this list (see Western Rise below), but
        guess what? They shouldn’t. A stunning stock photograph of a
        professional surfer hanging ten would be far less effective than these
        visuals of kids having fun on their boards. From the cursive fonts to
        the hand-drawn arrows, Wavehuggers’ style reflects the relaxed vibes of
        surfer culture.

      This landing page from Woolx uses high-resolution photography and video
      backgrounds to give visitors an up-close and personal look at their Rory
      Sweater. The product is made from 100% Australian Merino wool (that’s a
      type of sheep, FYI) to provide a stylish, breathable, and ultra-comfy
      piece of clothing. Now I think I finally understand what “apres-ski chic”
      means.

        that part was unintentional.)

        buying.

        <strong>Feature video:</strong> With apparel like this, it’s important
        to sell the lifestyle of the brand as much as it is to sell the product
        itself. The video on the page shows a woman preparing for an
        early-morning bike ride by lacing up her shoes and zipping up her
        sweater. It’s a subtle way of reinforcing who the target audience is.

    <p>
      I’m not very good at most exercises. I don’t really have any dance skills.
      And I certainly don’t have good rhythm. But for some reason… I think I
      maybe want to become a Zumba instructor now? That’s how good this landing
      page for teaching Zumba (created by the agency,
      <a
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label="Mutesix (opens in a new tab)"
        href="https://www.mutesix.com/"
        target="_blank"
        >MuteSix</a
      >) is. They make it seem totally accessible (and a whole lot of fun) to
      learn the steps and start teaching.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Industry</strong>: Fitness</p>
    <p><strong>Why it inspires…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Active photography</strong>: Zumba is all about movement, and
        this landing page captures that kinetic energy with high-res photos of
        people jumping, dancing, and laughing. The energy is practically
        radiating off the page, pumping you up to start your online training.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inspiring copy</strong>: With words like “booty-shaking” and
        “fresh music” used throughout the page, the copywriting here helps to
        hype up visitors as well. Even better, they promise that you’ll “thrive
        as an instructor” and “be part of something big” when you sign up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supporting videos:</strong> With fitness programs, it’s always
        important to show some video content to give visitors a taste of what
        it’ll actually be like to try this themselves. The page uses a
        combination of professional videos and instructor-created content to
        give you an inside look into the world of Zumba.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ABT: Always Be Testing</h2>
    <p>
      There you have it. These are some of the best landing page examples we’ve
      come across here at Unbounce, selected to represent a wide swath of
      industries with many different conversion goals. They don’t follow every
      best practice out there, but we hope you’ve found some qualities in each
      to inspire you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have one final piece of advice for you:
      <strong
        >no page is ever perfect—or, more to the point, every page can be
        better</strong
      >. And what works for one page (with one target market) won’t necessarily
      work for you. With this in mind, you should
      <strong>always be testing</strong> your landing pages. If you’ve got a
      page you’re already planning to tinker with, try running it through our
      <a
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
        href="/landing-page-examples/built-using-unbounce/beautiful-landing-page-design-examples/"
        target="_blank"
        >Landing Page Analyzer</a

      for some actionable steps you can take.

    <h2>Be the Michael Jordan of landing pages</h2>
    <p>
      When I was in middle school, I had a friend who gave up playing basketball
      after watching Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals. “I’ll never get anywhere
      near his level,” he told me, “so what’s the point?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Great landing page examples like the ones above should inspire you. But
      sometimes seeing other people’s awesomeness can have
      <strong>the opposite effect</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>But don’t give up!</p>
    <p>
      The good news is that
      <strong
        >most of these examples were built with Unbounce’s drag-and-drop
        builder</strong
      >. Though many take advantage of custom scripts to kick it up a notch,
      almost all these examples started in the same place as you will—with a
      brand, a blank page, and a big idea. Heck, some of these inspiring landing
      pages even started as
      <a
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"
        href="/landing-page-templates/"
        target="_blank"
        >Unbounce landing page templates</a
      >, though you’d never know it by looking at them. And we’re not tellin’.
    </p>
    <p>
      So swipe a few ideas from these examples, load up your favorite template,
      and, yeah… be the Michael Jordan of landing pages.
